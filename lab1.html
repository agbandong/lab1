		<p>My name is Adrian Bandong.</p>
		<p>Born on the 23 of October, I am the eldest son of my 4 siblings. My early school life involved me moving into different schools. This made me able to adapt to different social environments. I am adept at mathematics and was able to finish the Kumon program.</p>
		<p>I entered Asia Pacific College in hopes that I will learn to become a game developer that I will make games that matter to the world: Games that inspire people and help them become better and learn.

	<div>
		<p>Me and video games go way back. When I was a kid my parents let me play on an old computer playing pinball probably. I actually forgot what I played there since I was too young. When I was 6 or 7 years old, I had my first gaming device: a blue Gameboy Advanced.</p>
		<p>I learned how to use Game Maker during my junior high school years and made some minigames using it. As for right now, I am learning to use Unity to be able to make games.
