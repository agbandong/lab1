<p>Hello, I am Adrian Bandong. I am a college student from Asia Pacific College. I am an aspiring game developer. My favorite games are Civilization and League of Legends.
</p>
<p>I moved between 3 schools during grade school. In high school, I stayed in one school during junior high and moved in another during senior high. After I graduated I moved to Asia Pacific College in hopes that I could learn how to create games that matter.</p>
<p>My favorite app is Microsoft OneNote. I have been using it for about 5 years now. It can easily store my notes across multiple devices. You can put notes on multiple topics in the application separating them from notebooks from different subjects to pages and subpages. Having multiple notebooks makes it easier to segregate topics and put notes on it. You can also put screenshots and audio recordings in the app. Lastly, you can also invite people to be able to access and edit the data. You will need to use a Microsoft account however to be able to use the application. However, it is free which makes it accessible and for me has a good layout.
